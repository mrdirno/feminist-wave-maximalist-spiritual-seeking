## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character inherits a 'useless' spiritual tool (like the ability to taste lies) and uses it to solve a mundane, modern problem.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of a place (a subway car, a bodega) that is tired of being a passive container for human drama and spiritual traffic.
- Draft a 'recipe for reality' from the grimoire of one of Valentina's ancestors, blending practical magic, feminist theory, and kitchen-sink wisdom.
- Imagine a support group for people who perceive the 'membrane' and the 'spill.' What are their shared grievances and coping mechanisms?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Membrane Map' generator: a tool that takes a user's location data and overlays a procedurally generated spiritual topography (echoes, thin spots, beacons, spiritual traffic).
- Design a 'Spiritual Cross-Talk Simulator' that visualizes what happens when different belief systems (Santería, feminism, punk ethos) are forced to share altar-space, showing conflicts and synergies.
