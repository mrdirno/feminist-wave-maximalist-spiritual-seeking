  "cover_prompt": "A young woman, a modern beacon, stands in a vibrant, cluttered apartment kitchen, her hands resting on a bottle of artisanal mezcal as spectral, grandmotherly hands made of woven light and memory reach from the ether to adjust her grip, performing a sacred, intergenerational ritual. The scene is dense with urban animism: a philodendron vine pulses with a soft inner light, subway maps on the wall shift like living capillaries, and household objects cast intelligent, lingering shadows, all set against the backdrop of a neon-drenched city night seen through a rain-streaked window. In the intricate, symbol-rich, and mystically charged style of Remedios Varo combined with the maximalist pattern work and feminist narrative density of Bisa Butler and the contemporary digital collage aesthetic of Lola Dupre. Book cover framing, a perfectly centered and balanced composition that feels both intimate and cosmic, viewed from a low, reverent angle as if witnessing a private sacrament. Cinematic volumetric lighting where domestic lamplight collides with ethereal spiritual luminescence, using a rich, warm color palette of amber, burnt orange, and terracotta, contrasted with deep teals and electric magentas from the city lights. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
